Hello World,  :wave:




   I'm Cibele, graduated in Commercial Management and Information Technology. In 2019, I migrated from a sales career to programming (I know. You might be thinking that one thing has nothing to do with the other, but that's where you're wrong). Today, I don't meet the customer's needs by selling products, but by developing applications, using stacks like JavaScript, .NET, ReactJS, Angular, Tailwindcss, Bootstrap, Angular Material.
   I have experience with Jira, AWS CodePipeline, CI/CD.
   
   
   
:pushpin: Other facts about me:

  :blue_book: My training in commercial management and experience with analysis of the client's needs, allowed me to work even as a project manager, for a year and a half, of a payroll conveyor belt, with a Corban portal and a Backoffice portal with integration in the financial instuon.
 

  :pencil2: With that I worked with agile methodologies, prioritization of the backlog and contact with the squad and oriented according to the needs of the sprint.
